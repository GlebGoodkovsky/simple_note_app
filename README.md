---
This is an interesting project I'm making in order to experiment, learn, and develop my programing skills. It started as a console-only script and has now evolved into a simple, interactive web application.

---
## Features
- A clean web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Add new notes via a text input and a button.
- Add, Edit, and Delete notes with ease.
- Notes are automatically saved in your browser. They'll be waiting for you even after you close the page!
- A responsive design that works on different screen sizes.

Over time, I'm planning to slowy add more features.

---
## How to Use

- This project is deployed using GitHub Pages.
- There is no need to download or install anything.
- Click the Live Demo link at the top of this page.
- Type a note into the text box and click the Add button.
- To change a note, click Edit. The text will become editable. Click Save when you're done.
- To remove a note, just click Delete.
- reloading the page or closing the tab will still keep notes where they are

## How It Works
The app is built with three simple files working together:
*   **`index.html`**: Provides the structure and skeleton of the page.
*   **`styles.css`**: Adds all the styling to make it look nice.
*   **`simple_note_app.js`**: Contains the logic, or the "brain," that makes the app interactive.

### Code explained

#### CSS

```css
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    align-items: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

#notes-list li {
    margin-top: 5px;
    padding: 6px;
}

#add-button {
    margin-top: 8px;
}

#notes-list button {
    margin-left: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

#notes-list .edit-btn {
    color: green;
    background-color: rgb(208, 255, 200);
    border-color: darkseagreen;
}

#notes-list .delete-btn {
    color: red;
    background-color: rgb(255, 227, 227);
    border-color: coral;
}
```

- `body`: Styles the whole page. Uses a clean font and centers everything with flexbox.
- `#notes-list li`: Adds space between notes and a bit of padding inside each one.
- `#add-button`: Adds space above the "Add" button so it's not squished against the input box.
- `#notes-list button`: This is a general style that applies to all buttons in our notes list. It gives them some space and makes the mouse cursor a pointer.
- `#notes-list .edit-btn`: This is a **specific** style for the Edit button. It looks for any element with the class `.edit-btn` inside our notes list and gives it green "safe" colors.
- `#notes-list .delete-btn`: This is a **specific** style for the Delete button, giving it red "danger" colors. These specific rules override any general styles.

#### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<head>
    <title>Simple Note App</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>My Notes</h1>
    
    <input id="note-input" placeholder="Type a note...">
    
    <button id="add-button">Add</button>
    
    <ul id="notes-list"></ul>

    <script src="simple_note_app.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

- This HTML code builds the skeleton of the page.
- It creates the visible parts: a title (`<h1>`), a text box (`<input>`), a button (`<button>`), and an empty list (`<ul>`).
- The `id` on each element (like `id="note-input"`) is a unique "name tag". These name tags are very important because they are how our JavaScript finds and controls these specific parts.
- The `<link>` tag connects our CSS file for styling, and the `<script>` tag connects our JavaScript file, which is the "brain" of the app.

#### JavaScript

```js
const noteInput = document.getElementById('note-input');
const addButton = document.getElementById('add-button');
const notesList = document.getElementById('notes-list');

const saveNotes = () => {
  const noteTexts = Array.from(notesList.querySelectorAll('span')).map(span => span.textContent);
  localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(noteTexts));
};

const buildNote = (text) => {
    const newNote = document.createElement('li');
    const textSpan = document.createElement('span');
    textSpan.textContent = text;

    const editButton = document.createElement('button');
    editButton.textContent = "Edit";
    editButton.className = "edit-btn";

    editButton.addEventListener('click', () => {

        if (editButton.textContent === "Edit") {
            textSpan.contentEditable = true;
            textSpan.focus();
            editButton.textContent = "Save";
        } else {
            textSpan.contentEditable = false;
            editButton.textContent = "Edit";
            saveNotes();
        }
    });

    const deleteButton = document.createElement('button');
    deleteButton.textContent = "Delete";
    deleteButton.className = "delete-btn";

    deleteButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        newNote.remove();
        saveNotes();
    });

    newNote.appendChild(textSpan);
    newNote.appendChild(editButton);
    newNote.appendChild(deleteButton);
    notesList.appendChild(newNote);
};


addButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    const userText = noteInput.value.trim();
    if (userText === "") {
        return;
    }
  
    buildNote(userText);
    saveNotes(); 
    noteInput.value = "";
});

JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes') || '[]').forEach(note => buildNote(note));
```

1. **Creating Our Tools (Helper Functions):** The code first creates two main "helper" tools to do all the work.
    - `saveNotes()`: This is our "Saver" tool. It takes a snapshot of all the notes currently on the page and saves them as a list into the browser's memory (`localStorage`).
    - `buildNote()`: This is our "Note Blueprint". It knows how to build a complete note from scratch‚Äîthe list item, the text, and the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. It also teaches the buttons to call our `saveNotes()` tool whenever you finish an edit or delete a note.
2. **Using the Tools (Adding a Note):** When you click the "Add" button, the code is now very simple.
    - It grabs the text you typed.
    - It uses the `buildNote()` blueprint to create the new note and put it on the page.
    - It then uses the `saveNotes()` tool to save the updated list.
1. **Waking Up the App (Loading Notes):** The very last line of code is special.
    - It runs only once when the page first opens.
    - It checks the browser's memory to see if there are any notes saved from your last visit.
    - If it finds any, it uses the `buildNote()` blueprint to rebuild each one on the page. This is what makes your notes reappear

## A Note on the Learning Process

I want to be transparent about how this project was created. While the JavaScript code here was written with the help of an AI assistant, my goal is not just to have an AI build an app for me. I am using it as a tool to practice and genuinely understand the fundamentals.

My process involves asking for small, simple pieces of code and, most importantly, getting clear and simple explanations for what each line does, so I can learn in the process step by step. This project is my way of learning how to code *with* AI, not just getting a final product from it, and its a way to learn how to code in general, since I am new. It's helping me grasp the basics so I can eventually write this kind of code myself, or write with AI, but understand what it.

Feel free to let me know suggestions of what I can add/modify to improve this simple code
